# Source Code for Sensitivity Analysis of Feature Weighting for Classification

Materials & Methods
-----------

Materials used in the study are provide in ***dataset*** folder. The sensitivity of five popular classifiers which include ***k***-Nearest Neighbor (***k***-NN), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Linear and RBF kernels is measured to determine the most suitable algorithms for feature weighting. 

Demo
-----------
Run ***Main_fw.py*** for finding the feature weights and parameters of classifiers simultaneously

Run ***Main_def.py*** for finding the best solution from parametric search on unweighted data.
